# Rainfall Spiral Visualization

This project uses Pygame to create a generative art visualization of rainfall data as a moving spiral. The spiral's motion, color, and density are influenced by rain/water data, creating a dynamic and artistic representation of weather patterns.

## Features
- Animated spiral visualization using Pygame
- Rainfall data mapped to spiral density and color
- Easy to extend with additional weather parameters

## Usage
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install pygame pandas numpy
2. Place your rainfall data CSV in the project folder.
3. Run main.py to start the visualization.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Pygame
- Pandas
- Numpy

## Data Format
The CSV should contain at least a 'rainfall' column. You can extend the script to use more columns as needed.
